Welcome to John Malkentzos' personal website: a collection of recommendations for the finer things in life, as much as an American middle-class income can provide. 

I don't have much to share but what I do share is always my honest, real experience. I hate website writers who review products without actually trying the products, just to make some money off Amazon affliate links.
